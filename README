  While nap should be usable at this time, I have not yet finished
  testing everything on my server.  There may be some bugs I haven't
  encountered yet.  Hence v0.0.0.                                 TODO

  nap - nightmare(less) application platform

  nap is a configurable and extensible set of tools and templates that
  makes it easer to manage and deploy web applications.

    * Have new apps running in seconds.
    * Get a quick overview of running apps.
    * Update an app in seconds with a single command.
    * Allow developers to have their apps updated automatically when
      they push their code to the server.
                                                                  }}}1

  The only vcs currently supported is git, but others should be easy
