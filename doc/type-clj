=== The clj (clojure) type ===                                    {{{1

  This type is for all sorts of clojure-based application frameworks,
  like noir.

  The template is found in >> lib/type.clj.bash <<.  Feel free to
  fork, improve etc.


  === Options ===                                                 {{{2

    These can be passed to >> nap new <<.

    clj.nginx
      Optional; can be set to 'port'.  Will generate an nginx.conf
      file you can copy to an appropriate location.  Requires you to
      set clj.server.

    clj.server
      The virtual server.  You must set this if you use clj.nginx.

    clj.port
      The port the server listens on.  You must set this.

    clj.cmd
      Optional.  The command used to start the server.  The default is
      'lein trampoline run :prod' (unless modified in naprc).

      For a more advanced configuration, you can use a custom script
      (e.g. './_scripts/run-prod'); PORT is available as an envvar.

      Do not use foreman, it doesn't respond properly to signals and
      nap is unable to stop it.

      If you need to send the daemon a signal other than SIGTERM to
      stop it, you can prefix the command with the signal to be used
      (e.g. 'SIGINT cmd ...').

    clj.depcmd
      Optional.  The command used to install/update (dependencies).
      The default is 'lein deps' (unless modified in naprc); you
      should (modify naprc and) change this to 'lein compile :all'
      when using leiningen 2.x.

      For a more advanced configuration, you can use a custom script
      (like with clj.cmd); this can also be used to perform additional
      actions on update.
                                                                  }}}2
                                                                  }}}1
