  Nap is still in beta (< v1.0.0), not fully tested and I can't make
  any guarantees regarding backward-compatibility.  It seems to work
  well enough (we use it in production at the company I work at), and
  I don't intend to break compatibility unless there's a compelling
  reason to do so.  Have fun.
                                                                  }}}1

=== Description ===                                               {{{1

  nap - nightmare(less) application platform

  nap is a configurable and extensible set of tools and templates that
  makes it easier to manage and deploy web applications.

    * Have new apps running in seconds.
    * Get a quick overview of running apps.
    * Update an app in seconds with a single command.
    * Allow developers to have their apps updated automatically when
      they push their code to the server (using git).
                                                                  }}}1

    === Log commands ===                                          {{{3

      These allow you to list and view nap's logfiles.  If you've
      specified a logdir (relative to your app), <logdir>/*.log can
      also be referenced (with a prefix); e.g. <logdir>/foo.log is
      referenced as @foo.

      list                  lists names of logfiles
      files                 lists paths of logfiles
      assoc                 lists names and paths of logfiles
      tail <n> [<log(s)>]   shows the last <n> lines of the specified
                            logfiles (or all logfiles if none are
                            specified)
      monitor <n> <log>     shows the last <n> lines of the specified
                            logfile; shows appended data as the file
                            grows
      hist <n> [-v]         shows the last <n> commits
                                                                  }}}3

                    specified (or all apps if none are specified).

      naps pstart   Same as >> naps start <<, but starts apps in
                    parallel; output looks funny.

  * unix (tested on ubuntu; partially tested on osx)
  * bash
  * git

  Each app type (e.g. ruby, clojure) comes with its own dependencies.

  The only vcs currently supported is git, but others should be easy
  to implement.                                                   TODO
