=== The ruby type ===                                             {{{1

  This type is for all sorts of ruby-based application frameworks,
  like rails, sinatra etc.

  The template is found in >> lib/type.ruby.bash <<.  Feel free to
  fork, improve etc.


  === Options ===                                                 {{{2

    These can be passed to >> nap new <<.

    ruby.nginx
      Optional; either 'port' or 'sock'.  Will generate an nginx.conf
      file you can copy to an appropriate location.  Requires you to
      set ruby.server.  With ruby.nginx=port, requires you to set
      ruby.port.

    ruby.server
      The virtual server.  You must set this if you use ruby.nginx.

    ruby.port
      The port the server listens on.  You must set this unless you
      use ruby.nginx=sock.

    ruby.public
      Optional.  The subpath for static files; e.g. public.  Requires
      ruby.nginx.

    ruby.cmd
      Optional.  The command used to start the server.  The default is
      'SIGINT bundle exec rackup -E production ${LISTEN}' (unless
      modified in naprc; and yes, rackup is being silly and needs to
      be stopped with a SIGINT).

      You may want to (modify naprc and) change this to something like
      'bundle exec unicorn -E production ${LISTEN}' (for unicorn), or
      simply remove '-E production' (for development).

      All occurrences of '${LISTEN}' are replaced by either '-p $PORT'
      or '-l $SOCKET'; '${SOCKET}' and '${PORT}' are replaced with
      $SOCKET and $PORT, respectively.

      For a more advanced configuration, you can use a custom script
      (e.g. './_scripts/run-prod'); PORT/SOCKET are available as
      envvars.

      Do not use foreman, it doesn't respond properly to signals and
      nap is unable to stop it.

      If you need to send the daemon a signal other than SIGTERM to
      stop it, you can prefix the command with the signal to be used
      (e.g. 'SIGINT cmd ...').

    ruby.depcmd
      Optional.  The command used to install/update (dependencies).
      The default is 'bundle install' (unless modified in naprc).

      For a more advanced configuration, you can use a custom script
      (like with ruby.cmd); this can also be used to perform
      additional actions on update (e.g. precompiling assets).  See
      etc/rails-update-script.sample for a rails example.
                                                                  }}}2
                                                                  }}}1
